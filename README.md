# Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning on a Grid World

## About the Project
Deep Reinforcement Learning implementation of Policy Gradient on a simple Grid-World problem using PyTorch.

## Example

In ```main.py``` define the environment and the agent, as well as the hyperparameters of the policy gradient network and run ```python3 main.py```. The script saves a plot of the average rewards during training and validation. (See figure below for an example)
